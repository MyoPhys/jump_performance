# jump_performance
Cuban tree frog jump performance across scale and temperature

The file "Analyze Data.R" analyzes the scaling relationships for peak jump velocity and peak jump power over body mass, by reading in morphometrics from "Dissection Data.csv" and "Jump Performance Data v2.csv".

The output is graphs of the scaling relationships, and ANOVA summaries that describe the effects of size and temperature (as Q10s).

Please contact me with any questions or if you notice any errors or inconsistencies.
